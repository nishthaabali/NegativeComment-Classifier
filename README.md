# NegativeComment-Classifier
This project is a machine learning application that classifies comments into multiple categories of toxicity, including toxic, severe toxic, obscene, threat, insult, and identity hate. The project is implemented using TensorFlow for model training and Streamlit for creating an interactive web application.

Features
Model Training: Uses TensorFlow to train a text classification model on labeled data.
Text Vectorization: Utilizes TensorFlow's TextVectorization layer to preprocess and vectorize text data.
Real-time Predictions: Provides real-time predictions on user input comments, displaying results for each toxicity category.
